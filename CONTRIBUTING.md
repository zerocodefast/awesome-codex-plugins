## Adding a Plugin

> **Important: Read this entire guide before opening a PR. Submissions missing required items will be asked to fix them.**

### Step 1: Set up scanner CI in your plugin repo (required)

Your plugin repo must have the **HOL AI Plugin Scanner** running in CI before you submit. This is not optional. We verify this during review.

Add this file to your plugin repo at `.github/workflows/hol-plugin-scanner.yml`:

```yaml
name: HOL Plugin Scanner

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, master]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, master]

permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683 # v4.2.2
      - name: HOL Plugin Scanner
        uses: hashgraph-online/ai-plugin-scanner-action@v1
        with:
          plugin_dir: "."
          mode: scan
          min_score: 80
          fail_on_severity: high
          format: sarif
          upload_sarif: true
```

Wait for the CI to pass on your repo's main branch, then copy the workflow run URL.

### Step 2: Run the scanner locally and check your score

The release metadata below is synced automatically from the latest published HOL scanner release.

```bash
pipx install --force "plugin-scanner==2.0.886"
plugin-scanner scan . --format text
```

Expected reviewed wheel SHA256: `de2d09b3375c2240ead2dd15afb80e6fb2b118aa5ddd8b13c3d359f9837605a2`

If you want to verify the exact wheel before install:

```bash
rm -rf .hol-plugin-scanner-dist
python3 -m pip download --only-binary=:all: --no-deps --dest .hol-plugin-scanner-dist "plugin-scanner==2.0.886"
python3 -m pip hash .hol-plugin-scanner-dist/*.whl
```

You need a score of **80/130** or higher with **no critical or high severity findings**. Save the output to include in your PR description.

### Step 3: Verify your plugin repo has the required files

Your plugin repo must contain:
- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` (valid manifest)
- `SECURITY.md` (vulnerability disclosure policy)
- `LICENSE` (MIT or Apache-2.0 recommended)
- `README.md` (clear description)
- No hardcoded secrets, no dangerous MCP commands
- SHA-pinned GitHub Actions (if using Actions)
- Dependency lockfiles (`package-lock.json` or equivalent)

### Step 4: Fork this repo and add your submission

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Add your entry** to the appropriate section in `README.md` (alphabetical order)
3. **Add your plugin bundle** under `plugins/<owner>/<repo>/` (see [Plugin Bundle Requirements](#plugin-bundle-requirements))
4. **Add your entry** to `plugins.json` and `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` (maintainers can help with this if you're unsure)
5. **Submit a PR** with your scanner score in the description and a link to the CI run on your plugin repo

## Scanner Requirements (Mandatory)

All plugins submitted to this list **must pass the HOL AI Plugin Scanner**.

### Minimum Requirements

- **Score:** ≥ 80/130
- **Severity:** No critical or high findings
- **CI:** Scanner workflow must be running in your plugin repo's GitHub Actions (see Step 1 above)
- **PR description:** Must include scanner score or a link to the passing CI run

### Run the Scanner Locally

The commands below stay pinned to the same reviewed scanner release used in the submission guide.

```bash
# Install the current reviewed release
pipx install --force "plugin-scanner==2.0.886"

# Scan your plugin
plugin-scanner scan . --format text

# Or lint for quick fixes
plugin-scanner lint . --format text

# Verify install readiness
plugin-scanner verify . --format text
```

Expected reviewed wheel SHA256: `de2d09b3375c2240ead2dd15afb80e6fb2b118aa5ddd8b13c3d359f9837605a2`

### Required in Your Plugin Repo

Your plugin repository must include:

1. **`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`** — Valid manifest with required fields
2. **`SECURITY.md`** — Vulnerability disclosure policy
3. **`LICENSE`** — MIT or Apache-2.0 recommended
4. **`README.md`** — Clear description of what the plugin does
5. **No hardcoded secrets** — Scanner will flag API keys, tokens, passwords
6. **No dangerous MCP commands** — No `rm -rf`, `sudo`, `curl | sh`, `eval`, `exec` patterns
7. **SHA-pinned GitHub Actions** — If you use Actions, pin to commit SHAs
8. **Dependency lockfiles** — `package-lock.json` or `requirements-lock.txt`

### Scanner Score Breakdown

| Category | Max Points | What to Check |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Manifest Validation | 31 | `plugin.json` valid, required fields, semver, kebab-case |
| Security | 36 | `SECURITY.md`, `LICENSE`, no secrets, hardened MCP remotes |
| Operational Security | 20 | Pinned Actions, no `write-all`, Dependabot, lockfiles |
| Best Practices | 15 | `README.md`, skills directory, `SKILL.md` frontmatter, `.codexignore` |
| Marketplace | 15 | `marketplace.json` valid, safe source paths |
| Skill Security | 15 | Cisco scan clean, no elevated findings, analyzable |
| Code Quality | 10 | No `eval`/`new Function`, no shell injection |

**Total: 130 points.** Aim for 80+ to qualify.

## Example Workflows

Add this to your plugin repo at `.github/workflows/scanner.yml`:

### Basic CI Gate (Recommended)

```yaml
name: HOL Plugin Scanner

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, master]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, master]

permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683  # v4.2.2

      - name: HOL Plugin Scanner
        uses: hashgraph-online/ai-plugin-scanner-action@v1
        with:
          plugin_dir: "."
          mode: scan
          min_score: 80
          fail_on_severity: high
          format: sarif
          upload_sarif: true

### Lint-First Workflow (For Development)

```yaml
name: HOL Plugin Scanner — Lint

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, master]

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

        with:
          plugin_dir: "."
          mode: lint
          fail_on_severity: high
```

## Plugin Bundle Requirements

Every plugin submission must include a bundle under `plugins/<owner>/<repo>/` with the following structure:

```

    plugin.json        # Required - plugin manifest
  assets/
    icon.svg           # Required - plugin icon (SVG preferred, PNG acceptable)
  ...                  # Other plugin files (skills, commands, etc.)
```

### plugin.json

Must be valid JSON at `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` with at minimum:

```json

## CI Checks

All PRs to this repo are automatically validated. The CI will check:

1. **Alphabetical order** - README entries must be sorted within each section
2. **Plugin manifest** - `plugin.json` must exist and contain required fields
3. **Icon presence** - `composerIcon` must point to an existing file
4. **Marketplace sync** - `plugins.json` and `marketplace.json` stay in sync with README
5. **Markdown links** - All URLs in README must be reachable
6. **Scanner verification** - PR description must include scanner score or CI link

If CI fails, check the logs for specific errors and fix before re-pushing.

# Contributing to Awesome Codex Plugins

Thanks for helping grow the Codex plugin ecosystem!

## Adding a Plugin

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Run the scanner** on your plugin (see [Scanner Requirements](#scanner-requirements) below)
3. **Add your entry** to the appropriate section in `README.md`
4. **Add your plugin bundle** under `plugins/<owner>/<repo>/`
5. **Follow the format** described below
6. **Submit a PR** with a clear description and your scanner report

## Scanner Requirements (Mandatory)

All plugins submitted to this list **must pass the HOL AI Plugin Scanner**.

### Minimum Requirements

- **Score:** ≥ 80/100
- **Severity:** No critical or high findings
- **Action:** Your repo must have the scanner running in CI (see [Example Workflows](#example-workflows))

### Run the Scanner Locally

```bash
# Install
pipx install plugin-scanner

# Scan your plugin
plugin-scanner scan . --format text

# Or lint for quick fixes
plugin-scanner lint . --format text

# Verify install readiness
plugin-scanner verify . --format text
```

### Required in Your Plugin Repo

Your plugin repository must include:

1. **`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`** — Valid manifest with required fields
2. **`SECURITY.md`** — Vulnerability disclosure policy
3. **`LICENSE`** — MIT or Apache-2.0 recommended
4. **`README.md`** — Clear description of what the plugin does
5. **No hardcoded secrets** — Scanner will flag API keys, tokens, passwords
6. **No dangerous MCP commands** — No `rm -rf`, `sudo`, `curl | sh`, `eval`, `exec` patterns
7. **SHA-pinned GitHub Actions** — If you use Actions, pin to commit SHAs
8. **Dependency lockfiles** — `package-lock.json` or `requirements-lock.txt`

### Scanner Score Breakdown

| Category | Max Points | What to Check |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Manifest Validation | 31 | `plugin.json` valid, required fields, semver, kebab-case |
| Security | 36 | `SECURITY.md`, `LICENSE`, no secrets, hardened MCP remotes |
| Operational Security | 20 | Pinned Actions, no `write-all`, Dependabot, lockfiles |
| Best Practices | 15 | `README.md`, skills directory, `SKILL.md` frontmatter, `.codexignore` |
| Marketplace | 15 | `marketplace.json` valid, safe source paths |
| Skill Security | 15 | Cisco scan clean, no elevated findings, analyzable |
| Code Quality | 10 | No `eval`/`new Function`, no shell injection |

**Total: 130 points.** Aim for 80+ to qualify.

## Example Workflows

Add this to your plugin repo at `.github/workflows/scanner.yml`:

### Basic CI Gate (Recommended)

```yaml
name: HOL Plugin Scanner

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, master]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, master]

permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

      - name: HOL Plugin Scanner
        uses: hashgraph-online/ai-plugin-scanner-action@v1
        with:
          plugin_dir: "."
          mode: scan
          min_score: 80
          fail_on_severity: high

          format: sarif
          upload_sarif: true

      - name: Submit to Registry if Eligible
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, master]

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

## Plugin Bundle Requirements

Every plugin submission must include a bundle under `plugins/<owner>/<repo>/` with the following structure:

```
plugins/<owner>/<repo>/

    plugin.json        # Required - plugin manifest
  assets/
    icon.svg           # Required - plugin icon (SVG preferred, PNG acceptable)
  ...                  # Other plugin files (skills, commands, etc.)
```

### plugin.json

Must be valid JSON at `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` with at minimum:

```json

  "name": "my-plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "What this plugin does",
  "repository": "https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>",
  "license": "MIT",
  "interface": {
    "displayName": "My Plugin",

## CI Checks

All PRs to this repo are automatically validated. The CI will check:

1. **Alphabetical order** - README entries must be sorted within each section
2. **Plugin manifest** - `plugin.json` must exist and contain required fields
3. **Icon presence** - `composerIcon` must point to an existing file
4. **Marketplace sync** - `plugins.json` and `marketplace.json` stay in sync with README
5. **Markdown links** - All URLs in README must be reachable
6. **Scanner verification** - PR description must include scanner score or CI link

If CI fails, check the logs for specific errors and fix before re-pushing.
